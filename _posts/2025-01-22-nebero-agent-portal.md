## Introduction

I got introduced to the agent portal of Nebero, where I was tasked with analyzing the existing codebase. My goal was to understand the structure and functionality of the project.

## Code Analysis

To familiarize myself with the portal, I went through every file in the codebase, analyzing the logic and structure. This helped me understand how different components interact and how data flows within the system.

## Development Work

After completing the code analysis, I was assigned a new task:

- **UI Enhancements & Component Addition:** I worked on improving the UI of the page where agents are displayed. This involved fixing layout issues and ensuring a better user experience.
- **Component Implementation:** I added new components as per the requirements to enhance the functionality of the agent portal.

## Deployment

Once the UI fixes and component additions were complete, I tested the changes to ensure they worked as expected. After successful testing, I pushed the updated code to the production environment.
