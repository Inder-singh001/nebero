# Vue Practice Project

This project was created to practice and explore the **Vue.js framework**, along with **Express.js**, **Pinia**, and **Postman**. The repository can be found here: [nebero-vue](https://github.com/Inder-singh001/nebero-vue).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Vue.js
- **State Management:** Pinia
- **Backend:** Express.js
- **API Testing:** Postman
- **Form Validation:** Vuelidate
- **Routing:** Vue Router

## Learning & Implementation

### Vue Installation Methods

I explored multiple ways to install and set up a Vue project:

- Using the basic `vue` command
  ```sh
    npm create vue@latest my-project
    cd my-project
    npm install
    npm run dev
  ```
- With Vue CLI:

  ```sh
    npm install -g @vue/cli
    vue create my-project
    cd my-project
    npm run serve
  ```

- Using CDN (Direct Inclusion in HTML):

  ```sh
      <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"></script>
  ```

### Core Vue Concepts Applied

- **Reactive Fundamentals:** Used `ref` and `reactive` for state management.
- **Computed Properties:** Implemented derived state for optimized performance.
- **Directives:** Applied built-in Vue directives like `v-if`, `v-for`, `v-model`, `v-bind`, etc.
- **Lifecycle Hooks:** Used hooks such as `onMounted()` and `onUpdated()` for component lifecycle management.
- **Form Handling:** Implemented form input handling with Vue's two-way binding.
- **Props & Events:** Created reusable components, passing data via props and emitting custom events.

## Project Features

The project is structured as a **nested project** with **multiple mini-projects**, each demonstrating key Vue.js concepts:

### 1. To-Do Task Manager

- Add, delete, and update tasks.
- Used **Pinia** for state management.

### 2. Calculator

- Implemented a basic calculator with **reactive state**.
- Handled mathematical operations dynamically.

### 3. Notes App

- Create and delete notes dynamically.
- Used **computed properties** to filter/search notes.

### 4. User Management System

- **User Form & Listing**
  - Implemented a form to add users.
  - Used **Vuelidate** for form validation.
  - Displayed a list of users fetched from **Pinia store**.
- **Routing:** Implemented navigation between components using `route` and `router` functions.

### 5. Express.js API Integration

- Built RESTful APIs using Express.js:
  - **POST** - Create a new user/task.
  - **PUT** - Update existing records.
  - **DELETE** - Remove records.
  - **GET** - Fetch user/task data.
- Tested all API endpoints using **Postman**.
